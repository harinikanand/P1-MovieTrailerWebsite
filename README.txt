P1: Movie Trailer Website

To run Movie Trailer Website application, perform the following steps:

1. Install python 2.7.10 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/)
   Ensure IDLE which comes with the package is installed. Ensure the Path variable is set correctly 
   so the operating system can find the python interpreter.

2. Unzip the MovieTrailerWebsie.zip file to a folder on your computer.

3. Open the file entertainment_center.py file with IDLE (you can use the option "Edit with IDLE" when you right clik on the file)

4. Once the entertainment_center.py is opened, run the program clicking on Run -> Run Module.

5. This will automatically launch a webbrowser with the Movie Trailer Website titled "Fresh Tomatoes Movie Trailer".

The storyline, poster images were taken from Wikipedia and the Trailer URLs were taken from YouTube.
In addition, I have used the Movie Website example shown as part of the Udacity course "Programming Foundations with Python" as basis for my work.
